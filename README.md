# Emerging-Research-Measles-Research-Project
## Description
This research project focuses on analyzing the resurgence of measles over the past four years and its implications for healthcare infrastructure. It explores existing countermeasures against this major infectious disease from the 20th century and investigates opportunities for modernizing disease surveillance systems. Additionally, the project aims to implement participatory health informatics (PHI) techniques to address declining immunization rates. It also examines the effects of social media trends on measles awareness and vaccination efforts.
